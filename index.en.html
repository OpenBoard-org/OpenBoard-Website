                OpenBoard is an open source cross-platform teaching software for interactive

                Where is it from ?
            </h3>
            <p>
                OpenBoard was originally forked from Open-Sankoré 2.0, which was itself
                based on Uniboard. This fork was created to refocus the software on its
                original core functionalities and values, that is the work of a teacher
                in a classroom, privileging the ease of use. The evolution of this software
                will therefore take place in accordance with these core principles.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Cross-platform
            </h3>
            <p>
                Supported platforms are Windows, macOS and Linux.
            </p>
            <h3>
                Who is involved?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Currently, OpenBoard is maintained by the Education Department (DIP) of
                the canton of Geneva, in Switzerland. The University of Lausanne, who developped
                the original Uniboard software in 2003 has joined the effort by means of
                a logistical and financial contribution. An association project will be
                developed in 2019.
            </p>
            <p>
                A meeting was held in June 2016 between representatives from the universities
                of Lausanne, Neuchâtel, Fribourg and Geneva, the departments of Education
                from the cantons of Geneva and Jura as well as various institutions from
                the canton of Vaud (Switzerland) to together reflect on the desired evolution
                of OpenBoard.

                What's next ?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Interest is growing fast across Switzerland but also in Europe and North
                America. A swiss law non-profit organisation should be created. This organisation
                would promote OpenBoard and its open source development and foster collaboration
                between interested parties. This in respect of the core principles which
                led to the creation of this fork, that is the refocusing on the work of
                a teacher in a classroom, privileging the ease of use.
